# Naoko

Simple script that refreshes a site every X seconds.

## Why?

My server started doing some weird stuff so I left this running on my PC and recorded it to see in how long
does it crash.

## Setup

### Install dependencies

```shell
npm i
# or
yarn install
```

### Build

```shell
yarn build
```

## Configure

```shell
cp config.example.json config.json
```

Open `config.json` and fill it out.

### Run

```shell
yarn prod
```
